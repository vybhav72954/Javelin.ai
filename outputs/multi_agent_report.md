## Critical Priority Sites


### 1. Study_1 - Site 17 (ESP)

**Overall Risk Score:** 0.91

| Agent | Risk Level | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Safety | CRITICAL | 8 SAE reviews pending regulatory submission |
| Data Quality | HIGH | Data outstanding for 157+ days - stale query issue |
| Performance | CRITICAL | Site DQI (0.509) is 11.4x portfolio average - significant underperformance |

**Coordinator Synthesis:**
Executive Summary: The critical state of Site 17 is primarily due to three significant issues. First, the safety status is critical, with eight SAE reviews still pending for regulatory submission. Second, the Data Quality (DQ) has a high priority as data remains outstanding for over 157 days, attributed to a stale query issue. Lastly, performance is also critical. The primary concern is the urgent need for resolution of all these issues, with the top action being expediting

**Recommended Actions:**
- URGENT: Expedite SAE review - regulatory timeline at risk
- Route uncoded adverse events to medical coding team
- Consider site capability assessment and targeted training

**Estimated Impact:** High - Immediate regulatory or patient safety impact

### 2. Study_1 - Site 27 (CHN)

**Overall Risk Score:** 0.91

| Agent | Risk Level | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Safety | CRITICAL | 37 SAE reviews pending regulatory submission |
| Data Quality | HIGH | Single issue type dominates - systemic problem identified |
| Performance | CRITICAL | Site DQI (0.340) is 7.6x portfolio average - significant underperformance |

**Coordinator Synthesis:**
Executive Summary: Site 27 operation presents a CRITICAL priority due to multiple safety concerns (37 SAE reviews pending regulatory submission) and a systemic issue dominating the DQ rating, coupled with critical performance issues. The primary concern is the identified systemic problem that needs immediate attention, and the top action required is a thorough review and rectification of these critical issues for the safety and efficiency of Site 27 operations.

This summary reflects the urgency for corrective

**Recommended Actions:**
- URGENT: Expedite SAE review - regulatory timeline at risk
- Route uncoded adverse events to medical coding team
- Consider site capability assessment and targeted training

**Estimated Impact:** High - Immediate regulatory or patient safety impact

### 3. Study_21 - Site 916 (ARG)

**Overall Risk Score:** 0.91

| Agent | Risk Level | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Safety | CRITICAL | 41 SAE reviews pending regulatory submission |
| Data Quality | HIGH | Single issue type dominates - systemic problem identified |
| Performance | CRITICAL | Site performing within expected parameters |

**Coordinator Synthesis:**
Executive Summary: Site 916 presents a critical situation due to an outstanding number of 41 SAE reviews awaiting regulatory submission, coupled with high DQ issues dominated by a single type, indicating a systemic problem. The primary concern is the potential safety risk posed by the pending regulatory issues, and the top action should be expediting the submission process for immediate regulatory review to ensure site safety.

Action Plan: Prioritize the prompt submission of all 41 SAE

**Recommended Actions:**
- URGENT: Expedite SAE review - regulatory timeline at risk
- Route uncoded adverse events to medical coding team
- Continue routine monitoring

**Estimated Impact:** High - Immediate regulatory or patient safety impact

### 4. Study_21 - Site 950 (BRA)

**Overall Risk Score:** 1.00

| Agent | Risk Level | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Safety | CRITICAL | 37 SAE reviews pending regulatory submission |
| Data Quality | CRITICAL | Data outstanding for 77+ days - stale query issue |
| Performance | CRITICAL | Site DQI above portfolio average (0.055 vs 0.045) |

**Coordinator Synthesis:**
Executive Summary: The critical status at Site 950 is primarily due to three main issues: a pending safety review (37 SAE reviews), stale data queries affecting Data Quality, and significant performance concerns. The primary concern is the combination of the safety and data quality issues, as resolution is necessary before any further action can be taken. Top action required is prompt submission of the safety reviews and resolution of the stale query issue to ensure regulatory compliance and maintain site operations. Performance concerns should

**Recommended Actions:**
- URGENT: Expedite SAE review - regulatory timeline at risk
- Route uncoded adverse events to medical coding team
- Escalate stale queries to site management - unresolved for 60+ days

**Estimated Impact:** High - Immediate regulatory or patient safety impact

### 5. Study_21 - Site 1110 (USA)

**Overall Risk Score:** 1.00

| Agent | Risk Level | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Safety | CRITICAL | 36 SAE reviews pending regulatory submission |
| Data Quality | CRITICAL | Data outstanding for 97+ days - stale query issue |
| Performance | CRITICAL | Site DQI above portfolio average (0.045 vs 0.045) |

**Coordinator Synthesis:**
Executive Summary: Site 1110 faces a Critical priority due to multiple pressing issues. The primary concern revolves around the safety domain, with 36 SAE reviews pending regulatory submission. Additionally, a Data Quality issue has persisted for over 97 days, attributed to a stale query problem.

Top Action: Immediate attention is required to resolve the safety and data quality concerns by expediting regulatory submissions and addressing the stale query issue to ensure operational continu

**Recommended Actions:**
- URGENT: Expedite SAE review - regulatory timeline at risk
- Escalate stale queries to site management - unresolved for 60+ days
- Continue routine monitoring

**Estimated Impact:** High - Immediate regulatory or patient safety impact

### 6. Study_21 - Site 175 (ARG)

**Overall Risk Score:** 0.91

| Agent | Risk Level | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Safety | CRITICAL | 30 SAE reviews pending regulatory submission |
| Data Quality | HIGH | Single issue type dominates - systemic problem identified |
| Performance | CRITICAL | Site performing within expected parameters |

**Coordinator Synthesis:**
Executive Summary: Site 175 presents a critical situation with multiple safety concerns (30 SAE reviews pending regulatory submission) and a high-risk quality issue, where a single problem type dominates and a systemic problem has been identified. The primary concern is the severe impact on safety and performance. Top action should be focused on addressing these critical issues to ensure immediate compliance with regulations and mitigate potential risks.

Primary Concern: Severe safety and performance concerns due to

**Recommended Actions:**
- URGENT: Expedite SAE review - regulatory timeline at risk
- Route uncoded adverse events to medical coding team
- Continue routine monitoring

**Estimated Impact:** High - Immediate regulatory or patient safety impact
