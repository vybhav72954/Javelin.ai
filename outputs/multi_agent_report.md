## Critical Priority Sites


### 1. Study_24 - Site 888 (DEU)

**Overall Risk Score:** 1.00

| Agent | Risk Level | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Safety | CRITICAL | 29 SAE reviews pending regulatory submission |
| Data Quality | CRITICAL | 10 visits not completed - protocol deviation risk |
| Performance | CRITICAL | Site DQI (0.319) is 6.3x portfolio average - significant underperformance |

**Coordinator Synthesis:**
Executive Summary: Site 888 faces a critical situation due to numerous safety reviews pending regulatory submission (29 SAE), uncompleted visits (10) potentially leading to protocol deviation risks, and critical performance issues. The primary concern is the urgent need for addressing these safety and performance concerns to ensure compliance and the top action should be prioritizing completion of pending reviews, visits, and resolving performance issues.

Recommendation: Immediately address the critical safety

**Recommended Actions:**
- URGENT: Expedite SAE review - regulatory timeline at risk
- Route uncoded adverse events to medical coding team
- Escalate stale queries to site management - unresolved for 60+ days

**Estimated Impact:** High - Immediate regulatory or patient safety impact

### 2. Study_1 - Site 27 (CHN)

**Overall Risk Score:** 1.00

| Agent | Risk Level | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Safety | CRITICAL | 40 SAE reviews pending regulatory submission |
| Data Quality | CRITICAL | Data quality within acceptable parameters |
| Performance | CRITICAL | Site DQI (0.343) is 6.8x portfolio average - significant underperformance |

**Coordinator Synthesis:**
Executive Summary: Site 27 operations face a CRITICAL status due to pending Safety reviews, performance issues, and a critical data quality situation that is within acceptable parameters. The primary concern lies in the safety reviews and the associated 40 SAE findings awaiting regulatory submission. The top action required is to expedite the regulatory submission process for these safety reviews to ensure operational continuity and maintain safety standards.

Top Priority Action: Expedite the regulatory submission of 40

**Recommended Actions:**
- URGENT: Expedite SAE review - regulatory timeline at risk
- Route uncoded adverse events to medical coding team
- Continue routine data monitoring

**Estimated Impact:** High - Immediate regulatory or patient safety impact
