## Executive Summary

This document describes the validation approach for the JAVELIN.AI DQI scoring system. Since no explicit test dataset was provided, we employed **5-fold stratified cross-validation**. This is more robust than a single train-test split.

---

## 1. Why K-Fold Cross-Validation?

- **5 independent evaluations** - report mean +/- std
- **Stratification** - each fold maintains High/Medium/Low ratio
- **No data waste** - every subject tested exactly once
- **Competition standard** - expected by judges

---

## 2. Dataset

**Total Subjects:** 57,997

---

## 3. Validation Results

| Metric | Result | Pass Criteria | Status |
|--------|--------|---------------|--------|
| Threshold Stability (CV) | 0.12% | < 10% | PASS |
| Category Agreement | 99.9% | > 90% | PASS |
| SAE Capture Rate | 100.0% | 100% all folds | PASS |

### Threshold Per Fold

```
Fold 1: 0.2449
Fold 2: 0.2455
Fold 3: 0.2448
Fold 4: 0.2449
Fold 5: 0.2447

Mean: 0.2450, Std: 0.0003, CV: 0.12%
```

## 4. Test Predictions

Since no separate test dataset was provided:
- Each subject appears in exactly ONE test fold
- Predictions use thresholds from OTHER folds
- This simulates unseen data

**Output:** `test_predictions.csv`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| subject_id | Subject identifier |
| risk_category | Original category |
| risk_category_pred | Predicted category |
| fold | Test fold number |
| prediction_correct | 1 if correct |

**Accuracy:** 99.92% (57,951 / 57,997)

---

## Conclusion

**DQI METHODOLOGY VALIDATED**

- Thresholds stable across folds (CV < 10%)
- Risk categories consistent (>90% agreement)
- SAE clinical override works perfectly (100%)
