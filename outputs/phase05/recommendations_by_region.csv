Notably, there's an increased high-risk rate of 9.5% compared to the portfolio average of 9.3%, with a significant portion of sites (19.4%) posing high risk. Actionable steps could involve enhancing data collection and monitoring procedures in these high-risk s"

However, it's worth noting that 167 sites (11.3%) still present high-risk rates (8.7%), indicating potential issues at certain locations. A targeted review and rectification of these problematic sites could help improve the overall quality and consistency in this region."

Unknown,3,25,42,23,0.0118,0.2784,2.4,4.0,0,LOW,-76.6%,Unknown performing within acceptable range,"In the unspecified region with a DQI score of 0.012, there is a significant improvement in data quality compared to the portfolio average (0.050). This could be due to lower high-risk rates (2.4%) and fewer high-risk sites (1 out of 25 or 4.0%), indicating better data management practices. To maintain this positive trend, continuous monitoring and enhancement of data quality processes are recommended for sustainable results in the region."
