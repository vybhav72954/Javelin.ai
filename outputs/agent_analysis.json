The high number of missing visits and pages, coupled with a large maximum days outstanding, suggests that a substantial amount of valuable data might be missing or incomplete. Additionally, the presence of EDRR issues indicates potential data errors or inconsistencies. Furthermore, the low DQI score of 0.312 further emphasizes the poor data quality. Risk Level: CRITICAL"

This suggests there may be significant issues with data accuracy or completeness, which could potentially impact study outcomes and overall research integrity. Risk Level: CRITICAL"
