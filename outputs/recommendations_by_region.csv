ASIA,13,689,8504,18,0.0674,0.4503,9.5,19.4,838,CRITICAL,+33.7%,CRITICAL: 838 pending SAE reviews across ASIA,"In Asia, the DQI score indicates a slight increase in data quality issues compared to the portfolio average. Focusing on the high-risk sites, which account for nearly 20% of all sites, targeted interventions may be necessary to address underlying causes and reduce the high-risk rate of 9.5%. To improve overall data quality, collaboration between the 13 involved countries could prove beneficial in sharing best practices and resources."

However, an elevated number of high-risk sites (167 out of 1478) suggests potential vulnerabilities that need attention. To improve overall security posture, it might be beneficial to prioritize a focused risk assessment and remediation for these high-risk sites within the EMEA region. This targeted approach could help lower the high-risk rate and strengthen the cybersecur"

Additionally, the high-risk rate is slightly above the portfolio average, with 101 out of 1232 sites identified as high risk. To address these issues, it's recommended to prioritize targeted interventions at the high-risk sites and implement robust data quality control measures across the region to improve overa"

This implies enhanced data integrity and accuracy within this region. The high-risk rate has also decreased substantially (2.4% vs 9.3%), suggesting a reduction in potential issues that may affect data reliability. However, it is concerning that one site out of the 25 (4.0%) still p"
