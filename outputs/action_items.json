Prioritize the review and resolution of all outstanding SAEs.\n2. Ensure proper coding of MEDDRA terms by providing training or resources for site staff.\n3. Address missing visit issues through follow-up with site personnel to collect necessary data.\n4. Implement a strategy to reduce missing pages, such as providing clearer instructions or conducting additional training sessions.\n\nBy addressing these root causes and taking immediate action, we can significantly improve the data quality at Site 17",
