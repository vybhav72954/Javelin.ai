JAVELIN.AI - DATA QUALITY INDEX (DQI) MODEL REPORT
============================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
Total Subjects: 57,997
Total Sites: 3,424
Studies: 23
Subjects with Issues: 12,858 (22.2%)

RISK DISTRIBUTION
----------------------------------------
  High: 5,370 (9.3%)
  Medium: 7,488 (12.9%)
  Low: 45,139 (77.8%)

Capture Rate: 100.0%
SAE Capture: 100%

METHODOLOGY
----------------------------------------
1. Scoring: Binary (50%) + Severity (50%) x Weight
2. High: SAE pending OR top 10% of non-SAE scores
3. Medium: Any issue that is not High
4. Low: No issues
5. Site Risk: Based on average DQI score percentiles

FEATURE WEIGHTS
----------------------------------------
sae_pending_count: 20%
  Tier: Safety
  Rationale: Pending SAE reviews require immediate regulatory attention

uncoded_meddra_count: 15%
  Tier: Safety
  Rationale: Uncoded adverse event terms prevent proper safety signal detection

missing_visit_count: 12%
  Tier: Completeness
  Rationale: Missing visits mean missed safety assessments and protocol deviations

missing_pages_count: 10%
  Tier: Completeness
  Rationale: Missing CRF pages indicate incomplete subject records

lab_issues_count: 10%
  Tier: Completeness
  Rationale: Lab data issues can mask abnormal safety values

max_days_outstanding: 8%
  Tier: Timeliness
  Rationale: Delayed data entry reduces real-time safety monitoring capability

max_days_page_missing: 6%
  Tier: Timeliness
  Rationale: Long-outstanding missing pages indicate systemic site issues

uncoded_whodd_count: 6%
  Tier: Coding
  Rationale: Uncoded drug terms affect concomitant medication tracking

edrr_open_issues: 5%
  Tier: Reconciliation
  Rationale: Open external data reconciliation issues need resolution

n_issue_types: 5%
  Tier: Composite
  Rationale: Multiple concurrent issue types indicate systemic problems

inactivated_forms_count: 3%
  Tier: Administrative
  Rationale: Inactivated forms are corrections, lowest risk priority

VALIDATION RESULTS
